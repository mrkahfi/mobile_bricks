# mobile_bricks

## Getting Started

### ðŸŽ¯ Pub.dev
Install `mason_cli` from **[pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/mason_cli)**

```
# ðŸŽ¯ Activate from https://pub.dev
dart pub global activate mason_cli
```

### ðŸ§± Add all the available bricks

- Go to the root of your mobile project and initialize Mason:

```
mason init
```

- Open `mason.yaml` and add the following lines as a child of `brick`

```
# List all the bricks
bricks:
  app_scaffolding:
      git:
        url: https://github.com/zero-one-group/mobile_bricks.git
        path: app_scaffolding
```

NOTE: Currently we have only one brick called `app_scaffolding`. We're still working on other bricks.

- Get the bricks

```
mason get
```

## Use Cases 

### ðŸš€ Project Initialization
Instead of having a useless default "counter-app" project, use brick `zot_starter_mobile`. Just go to the root of your mobile project and run this command.

```
# initialize Mason 
mason make zot_starter_mobile
```

This initializes the whole starter app setup.

### Module Creation

## ðŸ“¦ Contributing
All the contribution are welcome. You can either file an issue, open a PR, or create a new impactful brick others can benefit from.
If you're making significant changes or refactor to the existing bricks, please elaborate your take on it.
