## Getting Started 🚀


### 🔖 Pre-requisites

To have the generated project working with Firebase, it requires:

0. Already initialized a Flutter project using `flutter create` or `nx-flutter:create`
1. Installed Firebase CLI
2. A Firebase Project

#### 1️⃣ Installed Firebase CLI

- Install [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/cli)

```
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

- Login to Firebase account that you will use to create a Firebase project.

```
firebase login
```

#### 2️⃣ A Firebase Project

Login to your Firebase console and [create a Firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/). Then, note the **project ID**.

### Make It

1. Make sure you already have Mason initialized in your project. If you don't, please [initialize first](https://github.com/zero-one-group/mobile_bricks#getting-started).
2. Run this command.
```
# initialize Mason 
mason make app_scaffolding
```

This is a starting point for a new brick.

## Quick start
This is a normal flutter app. You should follow the instructions in the [official documentation](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install).
This project uses **Riverpod** as a caching and data-binding framework

## ABOUT ZOG UI

**IMPORTANT NOTE ON ZOG UI:** 

Zero One has just developed a package called [ZOG UI](https://pub.dev/packages/zog_ui). Its goal is to speed up the UI development process by providing a collection of ready-to-use components, yet still attempting to maintain their customizability.

However, **the package is currently still on alpha release and lacks documentation**. Therefore, consider using ZOG UI components pragmatically. If you encounter issues in some components, **DO** implement your own components instead of relying on all of ZOG UI components by trying to customize them.

## Todo
* [ ] Mason for NX workspace
